# Water Meter
#
# The blue LED tells the device is powered on (built-in on the Wemos D1 mini).
# The green LED blinks when a pulse is measures (each liter of water used).
# The red LED shows if there is a problem:
# - Blinks slow (once a second): Connection disrupted
# - Blinks fast: ESPHome has an error settings up
# - Off: All fine!

  # WARNING! DO NOT USE THIS SENSOR IN HOME ASSISTANT!
  #
  # I see many of you using this sensor in Home Assistant, but please, don't.
  # There is no need to have an update of the uptime, just send the timestamp
  # of when the device started ONCE. It will have the same effect and saves
  # you system tons of processing and recording.

  # Uptime Timestamp Sensor
  #
  # This sensor is an alternative for the uptime sensor, which only sends the
  # startup timestamp of the device ONCE! Instead of sending updates to
  # Home Assistant constantly.
  #
  # This saves you tons of updates to be processed and, if recorded/stored in the
  # Home Assistant database, many many less rows.
  #
  # This sensor can be triggered manually and will only update the status once!
